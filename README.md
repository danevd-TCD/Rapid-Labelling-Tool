Basic operation instructions are: first, either add the env folder as a virtual environment in your IDE of choice, or else install the required packages through PIP using requirements.txt. Then run Prototype\_Rapid\_Labelling\_Tool.py . 

Note: The program only accepts input visual data (images) in .jpg file format.
